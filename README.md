# House-Price-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
In this project, the application will allow users to input specific parameters, such as location, built-up area, specifications, amenities, etc., and the algorithm will calculate the predicted price of the house by utilizing techniques like Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Support Vector Regression (SVM).

preprocessed the datasets from Kaggle by refining them, eliminating redundancies, and correcting inaccuracies in the data.

Achieved outstanding predictive accuracy, with the MLR model achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 96% and the SVM model attaining 92% accuracy.
