# House-Price-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
In this project, we are creating a website that will allow users to input specific parameters, such as location, built-up area, specifications, amenities, etc., and the algorithm will calculate the predicted price of the house by using regression techniques like Multiple Linear Regression and Support Vector Regression.
